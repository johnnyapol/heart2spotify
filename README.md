# heart2spotify 
------------

A simple tool for synchronizing iHeartRadio stations to Spotify playlists. 

## Motivation

Some of my favorite radio stations are owned by iHeartRadio, notably: *Radio 104.5 - Philadelphia's Alternative Rock*. They are a large source of music discovery for me; however, in recent times I haven't been listening to the radio much. heart2spotify scrapes the 'Recently Played' list associated with iHeartRadio stations, determines which songs aren't in the playlist, and adds them. This means I can be free to discover new music from these stations at my leisure using my music player of choice.

Two playlists I run can be found here as a demonstration:

* (Radio 104.5 - Philadelphia's Alternative Rock)[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3GvVJRnFtGZdYqfkLB49fP?si=97f23e858fd048e9]
* (Q102 - Philly's #1 Hit Music Station)[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1uDMEEZiz9gN3AyQEfWLjN?si=c2f9fe4b94bd4e79]


## How to use

Documentation will be improved as I have more time. For now, see `config.json.sample` for configuring the progrma. Configurations should be saved as `config.json`.

## Requirements

Python 3.6+

See `requirements.txt` for an up-to-date list of dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
